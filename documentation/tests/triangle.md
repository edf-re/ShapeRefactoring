> Note: A triangle should only be constructable from the "Classify" method/function. The test cases should not be able to construct it directly.

### A Triangle should contain the points that constructed it

This will verify that a triangle returned from the classification process will grant access to the first three distinct points that were given to the process.

### A Triangle should have three legs which are line segments constructed from the points

This will verify that the Triangle will grant access to three line segments forming its sides. The Sides will have the names:

- Side A
- Side B
- Side C

### A Triangle should have the correct angles

This will verify that the Triangle will have the expected angles such that:

1. "Angle A" is opposite "Side A"
1. "Angle B" is opposite "Side B"
1. "Angle C" is opposite "Side C"
1. All angles add up to 180 degrees.
1. The degrees of each angle is correctly calculated.

> Note: The angle in degrees can be calculated using the following formula:

```console
A = length of Side A
B = length of Side B
C = length of Side C

∠A = ACOS((B² + C² - A²) / (2BC))(180/π)
∠B = ACOS((A² + C² - B²) / (2AC))(180/π)
∠C = ACOS((A² + B² - C²) / (2AB))(180/π)
```

### A Triangle should have the correct area

This will verify that a Triangle will grant access to its area which is correctly calculated.

> Note: The area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's Formula. (Thanks to [omnicalculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/triangle-area)).

```console
A = length of Side A
B = length of Side B
C = length of Side C

area = ¼√((A + B + C)(-A + B + C)(A - B + C)(A + B - C))
```

### A Triangle should have the correct perimeter

This will verify that the Triangle will grant access to its perimeter which will be equal to the sum of its three side lengths.
