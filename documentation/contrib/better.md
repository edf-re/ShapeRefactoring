### Reporting Needed Changes

Please feel free to submit bug reports and change requests as long as they are not requests to add a language. I am recruiting language experts to help with each language so, if you want to add a language, I invite you to do so.

### Bugs

So... If you find a bug in the app code, that is awesome! It now becomes a reason for people to fix it. Please tell me about it, so that I can add it to the documentation.

If you find a bug in the tests, well that is a different issue. Please either report it or fix it and submit a pull request.

### Optimizations / Enhancements

You may find a destructuring that can be done to the app code, a spelling error or other change that would make the exercise better. Please either report it, or make the change (test supported of course) and submit a pull request.
