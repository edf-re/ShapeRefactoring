When developing this exercise I used two tools I want to call out. The first is ```Gittey```.

**[Gittey](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gittey)** is a free command automation that has understanding of git. It is used to help automate workflows. I have also used it to ensure a common feel between exercises of different languages.

**[Book Lisp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/booklisp)** is a mark down document generator that was used to build the document you are currently reading. Book Lisp allows me to break the document into smaller manageable chunks and then compile them into bigger documents.

Both of these tools were created and maintained by [Chris Stead](https://github.com/cmstead). I give him a due thanks for the work he puts into making developer lives easier.
